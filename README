4. Used textbook, and information from lecture.

Notes:

I rewrote the parser to be closer to the way the book describes it, using a
class, and consuming tokens from a generator as the code is processed. I'd
rather have made it more functional and recursive, but at least it works now.

Tokenizer usage:

    python tokenizer.py MyFile.jack 
    # Writes to MyFileT.xml

Parser usage:

    python parser.py MyFileT.xml
    # Writes to MyFile.xml
