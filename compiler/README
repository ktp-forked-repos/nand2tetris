Notes:

I completed up to slide 20 of "L23-Compiler6", so both the empty program and
"Seven" compile correctly. The symbol table is fully functional, and tracks
current class and function. Python 2 is required, because generators in
Python 3 don't have a .next() method.

Compiler usage:

    python compiler.py MyFile.jack
    # Writes to MyFile.vm

The compiler should work on directories as well, writing the output into the
*current working dir*, not the input directory.
