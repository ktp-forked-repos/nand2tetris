Notes:

This one uses a Python 3 syntax for splitting lists, so it will fail on
Python 2.x. I tested with 3.4, but 3.3 should be just as good. The output is
optimized beyond the pop_to_d/push_from_d primitives discussed in class, and
should use significantly fewer instructions in most cases.

Usage:

    python3 vm.py MyFile.vm > MyFile.asm
