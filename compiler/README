Notes:

Possibly incomplete solution.
Python 2 is required, because generators in Python 3 don't have a .next() method.

Compiler usage:

    python compiler.py MyFile.jack
    # Writes to MyFile.vm

The compiler should work on directories as well, writing the output into the
*current working dir*, not the input directory.
